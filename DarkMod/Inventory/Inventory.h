 /* DESCRIPTION: This file contains the inventory handling for TDM. The inventory 
 * has nothing in common with the original idInventory and is totally independent
 * from it. It contains the inventory itself, the groups, items and cursors for
 * interaction with the inventory.
 * Each entity has exactly one inventory. An inventory is created when the entitie's
 * inventory is accessed for th first time and also one default group is added 
 * named "DEFAULT".
 *
 * Each item belongs to a group. If no group is specified, then it will be 
 * put in the default group. Each item also knows it's owning entity and the
 * entity it references. When an entity is destroyed, it will also destroy
 * it's item. Therefore you should never keep a pointer of an item in memory
 * and always fetch it from the inventory when you need it, as you can never 
 * know for sure, that the respective entity hasn't been destroyed yet (or
 * the item itself).
 *
 * Categories and inventories are not cleared even if they are empty. Only when 
 * the owning entity is destroyed, it will destroy it's inventory along with
 * all groups and items. Keep in mind that destroying an item does NOT mean 
 * that the entity is also destroyed. After all, an entity can be an item
 * but it doesn't need to and it can exist without being one. Only the item
 * pointer is cleared, when the item is destroyed.
 * You should also not make any assumptions about item or group orderings as
 * they can be created and destroyed in arbitrary order. Only the default
 * group is always at index 0.
 *
 * Inventories are accessed via a cursor. This way you can have multiple
 * cursors pointing to the same inventory with different tasks. You can
 * also add a ignore filter, so that a given cursor can only cycle through
 * a subset of the existing categories in a given inventory.

/**
 * An inventory is a container for groups of items. An inventory has one default group
 * which is always created. All other groups are up to the mapper to decide.
 *
 * If an item is put into an inventory, without specifying the group, it will be put
 * in the default group which is always at index 0 and has the name DEFAULT.
