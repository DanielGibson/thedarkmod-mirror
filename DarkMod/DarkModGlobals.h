 * Revision 1.42  2007/01/17 03:44:19  thelvyn
 * *** empty log message ***
 *
 * Revision 1.41  2006/12/09 17:30:20  sophisticatedzombie
 * Added  a configurable scale for computing maximum observation distance from
 * a lighting quotient given for a point by the LAS.  Visual acuity of the AI still needs
 * to be factored in afterword.
 *
 * Revision 1.40  2006/11/03 23:20:17  sparhawk
 * Lockpick Logclass added.
 *
 * Revision 1.39  2006/08/08 21:27:45  sparhawk
 * Added an accessor for the bufferlength in th CImage class.
 *
 * Revision 1.38  2006/07/20 21:07:25  sparhawk
 * Frame logging fixed.
 *

 *
 * Revision 1.34  2006/05/02 00:09:23  sophisticatedzombie
 * Added m_drawAIDebugGraphics. It defaults to 0.0 which is off. Values >= 1.0 draw the AI debug graphics for that number of milliseconds
 *
 * Revision 1.33  2006/01/31 22:34:44  sparhawk
 * StimReponse first working version

 * Lightgem renderpipe fixed
 *
 * Revision 1.23  2005/10/30 22:15:26  sparhawk
 * Renderpipe creation removed because D3 can handle the pipename on it's own.
 *
 * Revision 1.22  2005/10/26 21:12:42  sparhawk
