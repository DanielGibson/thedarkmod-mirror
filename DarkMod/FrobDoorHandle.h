/**
 * CFrobDoorHandle is the complement for CFrobDoors. 
 *
 * Basically, if a handle is frobbed instead of the actual door,
 * all calls are forwarded to its door, so that the player doesn't 
 * notice the difference. From the player's perspective frobbing
 * the handle feels the same as frobbing the door.
 *
 * When frobbing a door with a handle attached, the event chain is like this:
 * Frob > Door::Open > Handle::Tap > Handle moves to open pos > Door::OpenDoor
