// TODO: Add support for irreversible objectives/components

// TODO: Item in inventory?  Could put the inventory name in the second entdata parms
// that would allow automatic handling of objectives like put so many things in a chest,
// or give some AI so many things.  Maybe this isn't needed tho, maybe it could just be
// done with scripting in those particular cases.
// Basically we'd just have to make COMP_ITEM take a second ObjEntParms arg and make it
// match the name of the inventory to that as well as the rest.

// TODO: Right now, AI_FindBody stats does not track the stat of team of body found
// AND team of AI finding body.  It only tracks team of AI finding body.
// Whether an AI reacts to a body should probably be determined by the AI, for example,
// average guards wouldn't react to a dead rat, but an elite might.
// If that's the case, we don't have to track both variables in the stats, since
// AI will only call FindBody if they react to that type of body.

// TODO: Make difficulty a bitfield instead of a minimum integer value
