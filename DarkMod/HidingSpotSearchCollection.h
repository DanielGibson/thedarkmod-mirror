/**
* The purpose of this class is to contain all the hiding spot searches in use by
* the AIs in the game.  Hiding spot searches can be shared, so this holds all
* the searches and controls whether or not new searches are required.  
*
* An AI that would like a search done makes a call to the  singleton instance
* of this class and asks for a search for a given stimulus. If it is simlar
* enough to an existing search that search is re-used.
