--- Additional info about building the static 32-bit libraries libcurl and libxml2 ---

== libxml2 ==

Download libxml2 2.7.7, extract package into any folder, and run the following commands:

env CFLAGS="-m32" LDFLAGS="-m32" ./configure --build=i686-unknown-linux-gnu --with-legacy=no --with-regexps=no --with-zlib=no --with-iconv=no --with-iso8859x=no --with-schemas=no --with-schematron=no --with-python=no
make
sudo make install

The library is then located in /usr/local/lib/libxml2.a.
Copy that to darkmod_src/linux/libxml2/

== libcurl ==

Download the libcurl 7.21 source package, and extract it on your system, then run the following commands:

env CFLAGS="-m32" LDFLAGS="-m32" ./configure --disable-ldap --build=i686-unknown-linux-gnu --without-libidn --without-zlib
make
sudo make install

The library is then located in /usr/local/lib/libcurl.a.
Copy that to darkmod_src/linux/libcurl/
