=== Additional info about building the static 32-bit library libcurl ===

Download the libcurl 7.21 source package, and extract it on your system, then run the following commands:

env CFLAGS="-m32" LDFLAGS="-m32" ./configure --disable-ldap --build=i686-unknown-linux-gnu --without-libidn --without-zlib
make
sudo make install

The library is then located in /usr/local/lib/libcurl.a.
Copy that to darkmod_src/linux/libcurl/
