Compiling DarkMod on 32 bit Linux
=================================

For compilation under Linux, you need the following including their
prerequisites:

  * SCONS
  * Python
  * libdevil-dev
  * libdevil1c2
  * libboost-filesystem-dev

In addition, when running Doom and using the DarkMod, you will also need:

  * libmng1

To actually compile, you can use the script:

  ./linuxBuild.sh

If you have less than 2Gbyte memory, you might want to remove the "-j2"
switch from the scons line. This switch makes scons run two compiler in
parallel, and this eats quite a lot of memory and can result in very strange
compiling errors.

Compiling DarkMod on 64 bit Linux
=================================

If you run a 64 bit Linux distribution, you still need to build a 32 bit
version of DarkMod, since Doom3 itself only exists as a 32 bit version.

To get this to work, you will need to install the 32 bit compatibility libraries.

Under some distributions like SuSE these are installed by default, but on
Ubuntu/Kubuntu, you need to install the following:

  * ia32

In addition to this, you will also need libdevil-dev, libmng1 and libdevil1c2.
However, these libraries do not come in a compatibility version, only in different
versions for each architecture.

This means if you install them the regular way with your package manager, you
will automatically get the 64bit libraries (f.i. amd64) on your system and this
will cause errors like the following:

	...  lib/bv/frustum_gcc.os -lIL
	/usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /usr/bin/../lib/libIL.so when searching for -lIL
	/usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /usr/bin/../lib/libIL.a when searching for -lIL
	/usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /usr/lib/libIL.so when searching for -lIL
	/usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /usr/lib/libIL.a when searching for -lIL
	/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lI

To avoid this, fetch the i368 .deb package files from http://www.rpmseek.com/
and unzip them manually:

	libdevil1c2_1.6.7-5_i386.deb
	libdevil-dev_1.6.7-5_i386.deb
	libmng1_1.0.9-1_i386.deb
	libboost-filesystem1.34.1_1.34.1-2ubuntu1_i386.deb

(You might get slightly newer versions, but it should work)

Then, as root, copy all the files that are in these packages under ./usr to your
/lib32 directory.

Also, make sure that you rename the libboost_filesystem-gcc41-1_34_1.so etc. file to
just the basename like so:

	/lib32/libboost_filesystem.so
	/lib32/libboost_filesystem-mt.so

Then run:

	./linuxBuild.sh

It will pick up the correct libraries. Likewise, when running, Doom3 will
also use the right 32bit libraries.

Troubleshooting
===============

If you still get linker errors from ld, please make sure that the libraries
can be found under the right name under /lib32. Also, running:

	su ldconfig

might help.
